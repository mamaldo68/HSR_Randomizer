# Honkai Starrail Sim Universe Randomizer

This program will randomly select the path and the team comp the player should use  
while attemping a challenge run through the simulated universe.

## What to do if you don't have a selected character?

I've included all characters currently released as of patch 1.4  
if you do not own one just rerun the program until you get a team  
that you can use.

## How to use 

Within the terminal, navigate to the folder that you downloaded the script  
and run it using node.  
> node script.js
